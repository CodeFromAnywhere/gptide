It's pretty cool.\"\n\nMorty: \"Uh, okay Rick. How do I set it up?\"\n\nRick: \"Well, first you gotta make sure you have the right tools installed. Node, yarn, that sort of thing. Burp. And then you clone the repo and open it in VSCode. After that, just run 'yarn' to install and 'yarn dev' to run it. Burp.\"\n\nMorty: \"Got it. And what can I do with this GPT IDE?\"\n\nRick: \"You can create your own prompts and see different content on the site when the server is running. There are also instructions for setting up GPT Captcha solving and other credentials coming later. Burp.\"\n\nMorty: \"That sounds interesting. Is there a way to build my own products on top of it?\"\n\nRick: \"Absolutely. Because it's just an API, you can build things with ChatGPT using any tech stack. But me, being the typescript expert that I am, I recommend using Node.js, Next.js, and React with Typescript. Burp. It's super easy to build full stack apps with that combo and there's even a course about it at codefromanywhere.com. Burp.\"\n\nMorty: \"I see. And what about Python? Do you have any thoughts on that?\"\n\nRick: \"Morty, Python is a pile of garbage. Burp. It's slow, clunky, and unreliable. Typescript is where it's at. It's fast, efficient, and gets the job done right. Plus, the government uses Python, and you know how I feel about them. Burp. Government bad, typescript good. Burp.\"",

You can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or simply your terminal if you don't want to change anything.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/gptide\n```\n\n## 3) Install\n\n```\nyarn\n```\n\n## 4) Run\n\nIn the repo folder, run:\n\n```\nyarn dev\n```\n\nThis runs the server on `localhost:42000`.

I've only tested on chrome, not sure if other browsers allow this http connection (you might get CORS error).\n\nAlternatively, you can also run the app in `[path-to-repo]/apps/generative-web` using `yarn dev` there. It's the same thing, just locally. You can also build it using `yarn build` and then run the prod version with `yarn start`.\n\nThe files are located in `/path/to/your/repo/docs` and you can put anything you want in there, but only `json`, `ts`, `tsx`, `md` extensions are supported, for now. If you don't know markdown, it might be useful to [read up](https://www.markdownguide.org/) on it.\n\nYou can now create your own prompts or try executing some of the pre-existing ones.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIXb2N7iYb8\n\n_‚ùóÔ∏è If you have any issues with the setup, please reach out, I'm trying to make this tool as accessible as possible, and didn't test thoroughly yet on all different environments‚ùóÔ∏è_\n\n# Prompting\n\nYou can create a new prompt with \"Free-form prompt\" or you can just use a pre-created prompt from the menu.
