# Pricing

Pricing is **free now** but will cost **Â± 5 cents per prompt** later (to be determined)

## How?

GPT IDE will charge a margin on top of your API cost. Later, when the ChatGPT API comes out, we'll let you connect your own API key, and the requests will go through there. On top of that, you'll need to make your account on our platform and connect your creditcard here (using Stripe). We'll charge an additional 5 cents per prompt you make to the API.

## Why?

It has been a tremendous effort to put this together, it's not free forever. But for now, enjoy the beta!
