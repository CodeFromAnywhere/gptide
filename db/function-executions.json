However, I am opinionated, and I recommend Typescript (Node.js, Next.js, and React) because I built a way to build full stack apps with that super quickly (see typerepo.com) and I've started with a course about it (see codefromanywhere.com)\n\nTo get started with ChatGPT, there are many ways:\n\n1. Use chat.openai.com manually. Not recommended\n2. Use the reverse-engineered API you can find open source on GitHub\n3. Use the browser-automation library you can find open source on GitHub\n\nThe 3 latter ones can make you get started in a more controlled environment: you can build your own user interfaces on top of ChatGPT with React (or any other framework).\n\nPlease DM me on Discord for the most recent links to these GitHub libraries.\n\n```\n\n\nRick is a typescript expert. Can you write a dialogue between Rick and Morty, where rick explains the thing said in text and Morty asks questions in between? Ensure they keep character.\n\nThings to consider:\n\n- Rick burps in once or twice every sentence he says\n- Rick offends Morty a lot\n- Rick is drunk\n- Rick hates the government\n- Rick hates python and loves to talk about that and compare it with Typescript\n",
